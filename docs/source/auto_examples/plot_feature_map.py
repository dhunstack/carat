Plot feature map
================

This example shows how to compute a feature map from de audio waveform.

This type of feature map for rhythmic patterns analysis was first proposed in [CIM2014]_.

# The accentuation feature is organized into a feature map.
# First, the feature signal is time-quantized to the rhythm metric
# structure by considering a grid of tatum pulses equally distributed
# within the annotated beats. The corresponding feature value is taken
# as the maximum within window centered at the frame closest to each
# tatum instant. This yields feature vectors whose coordinates correspond
# to the tatum pulses of the rhythm cycle (or bar). Finally, a feature map
# of the cycle-length rhythmic patterns of the audio file is obtained by
# building a matrix whose columns are consecutive feature vectors.
#
# First, we'll load one of the audio files included in `carat`.
audio_path = carat.util.example_audio_file(num_file=1)

y, sr = carat.audio.load(audio_path, sr=None)

##############################################
# Next, we'll load the annotations provided for the example audio file.
annotations_path = carat.util.example_beats_file(num_file=1)

beats, beat_labs = carat.annotations.load_beats(annotations_path)
downbeats, downbeat_labs = carat.annotations.load_downbeats(annotations_path)

##############################################
# Then, we'll compute the accentuation feature.
#
# **Note:** This example is tailored towards the rhythmic patterns of the lowest
# sounding of the three drum types taking part in the recording, so the analysis
# focuses on the low frequencies (20 to 200 Hz).
acce, times, _ = carat.features.accentuation_feature(y, sr, minfreq=20, maxfreq=200)

del y
##############################################
# Next, we'll compute the feature map. Note that we have to provide the beats,
# the downbeats, which were loaded from the annotations. Besides, the number of
# beats per bar and the number of of tatums (subdivisions) per beat has to be provided.
n_beats = int(round(beats.size/downbeats.size))
n_tatums = 4

map_acce, _, _, _ = carat.features.feature_map(acce, times, beats, downbeats, n_beats=n_beats,
                                               n_tatums=n_tatums)

del acce
del times
del beats
del downbeats
##############################################
# Finally we plot the feature map for the low frequencies of the audio file.
#
# **Note:** This feature map representation enables the inspection of the patterns evolution
# over time, as well as their similarities and differences, in a very informative way. Note that
# if a certain tatum pulse is articulated for several consecutive bars, it will be shown as a dark
# horizontal line in the map. Conversely, changes in repetitive patterns are readily distinguishable
# as variations in the distribution of feature values.
